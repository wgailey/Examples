# Examples
Just code snippets I've written, all should have a readme, commit note, xor comments that explains them.


Javascriptspeedup is a simple javascript I wrote several years ago for simple webpages and slow servers that loads the entire website into the browser on user landing that makes interaction seemless.  
$("#networking").click(function(){
$("#data").load("html/networking.html");});
Basically what that says is "When you click #networking" load networking.html from the html folder into #data.
